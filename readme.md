-   Erase function in string -

        str.erase();                                // Deletes all characters 
        str.erase(1);                               // Deletes all characters except first one 
        str.erase(1, 4);                            // Deletes 4 characters from index number 1
        str.erase(str.begin() + 4);                 // Deletes character at position 4 
        str.erase(str.begin() + 0, str.end() - 6);  // Deletes all characters between 0th index and str.end() - 6   

**Thoughts :**

-   Stacks were love , is love and always will be love.
-   str.erase(1) would erase all characters after index 0 but str.erase(str.begin() + 1) would only delete character at index 1 . STRANGE! but useful! Need to understand more about iterators!
-   Should i register for Microsoft ?? (yeah! oncampus visit) , I was able to clear only till 2nd round last year , Is it of any use? .....üò∂üò∂
