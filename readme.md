### Day 1: August 07, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress :**

-   C++ - STL 
-   Started Algorithms specialization Course 1 on Coursera
-   Solved few basic c++ problems on Hackerank and Leetcode!

**What I learned :**

-   Vectors.
-   Introduction to algorithms.
-   Its better to take help from someone and do something, then not do anything all day.

**Thoughts :**

-   Decent start i guess...
-   Special thanks to my friend [Kuee](https://github.com/TheSherlockHomie) without whom i guess i would never have started!
-   And last, to the reader. Keep watching me please. Any help to keep me on track would be really helpful.
